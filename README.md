# noge.tk

My garbage code for [noge.tk](http://noge.tk)

The code is going to use MySQL or JSON for strings and hex codes (for colors) etc.

To run on your own you need a mysql database, [jquery](https://jquery.com/) (or you can just use [jquery hosted by google](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)), [jquery mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/) and [jquery color](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color).

You also need to modify the config.php file.

#Config.php

- `IG`
- `IGtoken` - Your [instagram token](http://instagram.pixelunion.net)
	(ig not used yet)
- `MYSQL`
- `ip` - Your mysql database ip address.
- `username` - Your mysql database user.
- `password` - Your mysql database user password.
- `database` - Your mysql database.
