# noge.tk

My garbage code for [noge.tk](http://noge.tk)

The code is going to use MySQL database for strings and hex codes (for colors) etc.

To run on your own you need a mysql database, [jquery](https://jquery.com/) (or you can just use [jquery hosted by google](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)), [bowser](https://github.com/ded/bowser), and you need to make a [connect.php](http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_mysqli_connect.asp) file (similar to the first example).
