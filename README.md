# noge.tk

My code for [noge.tk](http://noge.tk)

The code is going to use MySQL or JSON for strings and hex codes (for colors) etc.

To run on your own you need a mysql database, [jquery](https://jquery.com/) (or you can just use [jquery hosted by google](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)). And because TwitterApi requires authentication you need to get the [TwitterOAuth](https://twitteroauth.com/) library for PHP. And you probably need to change a lot of code to suit your needs... But I really don't see a reason for you to use this.

You also need to modify the config.php file.
